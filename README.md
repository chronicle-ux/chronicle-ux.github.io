Where it's at

## Setup

There's not a lot of wizardry here, but you'll need to do a few things to get this running locally

1. install sass (`gem install sass` on OSX, otherwise, figure it out here: http://sass-lang.com/install)
2. install node `brew install node ` or use nvm (https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
3. global install grunt `npm install -g grunt-cli`
4. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git`
5. `cd` into the repo
6. `npm install`

There's no liverelaod or watch server to deal with right now, just open the index.html file in your browser and you'll see everything. Styles are handled using Sass, and can be found in the `styles` directory (duh). to update styles just type `grunt` into the command line and then refresh your browser.

Thats about it. 

Ride the lightning.
